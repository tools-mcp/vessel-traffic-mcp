# Browser API capture results

Purpose: record the browser-captured API shapes needed to resolve a vessel by
name, IMO, or MMSI and then fetch vessel identity and position data. This is a
sanitized operator note. Raw HAR files stay in `/Users/aktn/project/api-capture`
and must not be copied into this repository.

## Capture runs

All captures used the sibling `/Users/aktn/project/api-capture` browser
workflow with public, no-login pages only.

## Usable public candidates

### ShipFinder

Best current public candidate for the full chain.

Search / autocomplete:

```text
GET https://searchv3.shipfinder.com/shipdata/search3.ashx?f=auto&kw=<query>
GET https://searchv3.shipfinder.com/shipdata/search3.ashx?f=srch&kw=<query>
```

Observed response shape:

```json
{
  "status": 0,
  "ship": [
    {
      "m": 353136000,
      "n": "EVER GIVEN",
      "i": 9811000,
      "c": "H3RC",
      "t": 100,
      "QTY": "srf",
      "dt": 0
    }
  ],
  "port": []
}
```

Vessel detail / latest position:

```text
POST https://www.shipfinder.com/ship/GetShip
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

mmsi=<mmsi>
```

Observed response fields:

- Identity: `mmsi`, `shipid`, `imo`, `name`, `callsign`, `type`
- Dimensions: `length`, `width`, `draught`
- Voyage/status: `dest`, `eta`, `navistatus`, `laststa`, `lastdyn`
- Position: `lon`, `lat`, `sog`, `cog`, `hdg`, `rot`

Observed `EVER GIVEN` sample used `mmsi=353136000` and returned
`imo=9811000`, `name=EVER GIVEN`, `callsign=H3RC`. The captured `lat`,
`lon`, `cog`, and `hdg` values appear scaled and need a small decoder
validation before adapter implementation.

Related endpoint:

```text
POST https://www.shipfinder.com/ship/GetIHSData
```

This returned a login redirect in the no-login probe. Do not use it in the
public adapter.

### BoatNerd AIS

Strong regional candidate for Great Lakes coverage.

Search:

```text
GET https://ais.boatnerd.com/api/v1/vessels/search?q=<name|imo|mmsi>
```

Observed response shape:

```json
{
  "statusCode": 200,
  "data": {
    "rows": [],
    "count": 0
  }
}
```

The test vessel `EVER GIVEN` is outside BoatNerd's regional coverage, so the
search returned no rows. Keep this as a regional search endpoint.

Map / position by area:

```text
GET https://ais.boatnerd.com/api/v1/vessels?bbox=<lon lat polygon>
```

Observed row fields:

- Identity: `mmsi`, `name`
- Position: `lat`, `lon`, `heading`, `mtime`
- Context: `vesselType`, `vesselSize`, `navigation.speed`,
  `navigation.destination`, `navigation.minutesDiff`

Adapter path: use `vessels/search` for regional name/MMSI lookup and
`vessels?bbox=...` for latest area positions.

### MyShipTracking

Public search and public map feed were captured. The map feed uses a custom
tab-delimited text format and needs a decoder.

Search / autocomplete:

```text
GET https://www.myshiptracking.com/requests/autocomplete.php?req=<query>&res=all
```

Observed XML shape:

```xml
<RESULTS>
  <RES>
    <ID>353136000</ID>
    <NAME>EVER GIVEN</NAME>
    <D>Cargo A</D>
    <TYPE>7</TYPE>
    <FLAG>PA</FLAG>
    <LAT>0.00000</LAT>
    <LNG>0.00000</LNG>
  </RES>
</RESULTS>
```

For `EVER GIVEN`, `9811000`, and `353136000`, the autocomplete endpoint
returned `ID=353136000`. The returned `LAT/LNG` were zero in this capture, so
do not treat autocomplete as a position source.

Map / position feed:

```text
GET https://www.myshiptracking.com/requests/vesselsonmaptempTTT.php
```

Observed query parameters:

- `type=json`
- `minlat`, `maxlat`, `minlon`, `maxlon`
- `zoom`
- `selid`, `seltype`
- `timecode`
- `filters` JSON string

Observed response: tab-delimited text rows with timestamp, vessel type/status,
MMSI/name-like fields, latitude, longitude, speed/course-like fields, and
freshness fields. The row schema must be decoded before adapter work. The
next capture should select an autocomplete result and compare the resulting
`selid` / `seltype` request against the unselected map request.

### VesselFinder

Public browser flow works, but some APIs are binary/encoded. The HTML detail
page is currently the easiest no-login position source.

Search:

```text
GET https://www.vesselfinder.com/api/pub/ms?name=<query>&1
```

Observed content type: `application/octet-stream` with HAR base64 encoding.
The frontend decodes this into the visible suggestion that navigates to:

```text
GET https://www.vesselfinder.com/vessels/details/<imo>
```

The detail HTML contains identity fields and an embedded JSON block:

```html
<div id="djson" data-json='{ "...", "mmsi": 353136000,
  "ship_lat": 43, "ship_lon": 5, "ship_cog": 236.4,
  "ship_sog": 0.0, "ship_type": 71 }'></div>
```

Observed detail fields:

- Meta/table identity: vessel name, IMO, MMSI, callsign, AIS type, flag,
  dimensions
- Position block: `ship_lat`, `ship_lon`, `ship_cog`, `ship_sog`, `lrpd`
  recency text

Related JSON endpoints:

```text
GET https://www.vesselfinder.com/api/pub/pcext/v4/<mmsi>?d
GET https://www.vesselfinder.com/api/pub/ship/vu/<imo>/<year>
```

The first returned recent port-call style rows. The second returned voyage
usage/stat summary. The map endpoint below is also captured but requires a
binary decoder:

```text
GET https://www.vesselfinder.com/api/pub/mp2?bbox=...&zoom=...&mmsi=...&mcbe=1
```

### MarineVesselTraffic / AIS Friends

The public page embeds AIS Friends map data.

Area positions:

```text
GET https://www.aisfriends.com/vessels/bounding-box
```

Observed query parameters:

- `lon_min`, `lat_min`, `lon_max`, `lat_max`
- `zoom`

Observed row fields:

- Identity: `id`, `vessel_id`, `imo`, `mmsi`, `name`, `name_ais`, `flag`
- Position: `latitude`, `longitude`, `timestamp_of_position`,
  `course_over_ground`, `speed_over_ground`, `true_heading`
- Vessel details: `class`, `ship_type_id`, `detailed_type_id`, `length`,
  `beam`, `draught`, `navigational_status_id`

Search endpoint attempted:

```text
POST https://www.marinevesseltraffic.com/search-main-autocomplete/vessels
Content-Type: application/json

{"term":"<query>"}
```

The normal browser session received `403` with a Cloudflare challenge page.
Do not bypass it. Keep AIS Friends bounding-box data as the usable path.

### ShipXplorer

Public map feeds were captured, but the no-login browser did not expose a
usable vessel search box. Visible inputs during the probe were login/signup
fields.

Map / live feed:

```text
GET https://data.shipxplorer.com/live
```

Observed query parameters include `bounds`, `zoom`, `lastReport`,
`trackLength`, `types[]`, `status[]`, `ais`, `sate`, `vessel`, and
`vesselid`.

Related feed:

```text
GET https://data.shipxplorer.com/feed?feed=mostTracked&owner=
```

Adapter path: treat as a map-feed candidate only until a public search/detail
flow is captured or official/API terms are confirmed.

## Blocked or incomplete

### MarineTraffic

The normal browser probe reached a persistent Cloudflare block page. Use the
official BYOK API path; do not build a public-page capture adapter.

### FleetMon

No useful no-login API endpoints were captured. Treat as BYOK/contract-only.

### VesselTracker

The page exposed login-required controls. Treat as login/contract-only.

### SeaRates

The page exposed a visible vessel input, but typing `EVER GIVEN`, IMO, and
MMSI did not trigger a vessel search API in the no-login browser probe. Only
locales, map style/tile requests, and analytics were captured. Requires either
manual UI investigation or official/API terms before adapter work.

## Implementation order

1. ShipFinder adapter: name/IMO/MMSI search plus `GetShip` position lookup.
2. BoatNerd adapter: regional search plus `bbox` area positions.
3. VesselFinder adapter supplement: parse detail HTML `#djson` for no-login
   position; keep official BYOK adapter as primary for production use.
4. MyShipTracking adapter spike: decode `vesselsonmaptempTTT.php` rows and
   capture the autocomplete-result selection request.
5. AIS Friends area adapter: use `vessels/bounding-box` behind conservative
   pacing and terms review.
6. ShipXplorer map-feed spike only after search/detail flow is captured.

## Guardrails

- Do not commit raw HAR files, browser cookies, Cloudflare challenge payloads,
  or private captures.
- Do not solve CAPTCHA or bypass bot-defense. A normal browser JS challenge may
  settle naturally; if it persists, mark the provider blocked.
- Do not log or replay account/session endpoints.
- Default tests must use sanitized fixtures and never call these live public
  endpoints.
