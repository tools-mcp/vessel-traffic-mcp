# Operator runbook (F6.AC3)

This runbook is the single entry point an operator needs to run
`vessel-traffic-mcp` against fixture data by default and, when explicitly
authorized, against real provider credentials. It covers four surfaces
that the rest of the runbook set assumes you already understand:

1. **Provider credentials** — how BYOK keys enter the process and how
   they stay out of logs.
2. **Rate limits** — what each provider declares and how the local
   limiter enforces those policies.
3. **Live-test toggles** — the `VESSEL_MCP_LIVE_TEST_*` flags that gate
   every paid or rate-limited call out of default verification.
4. **Client setup** — how Claude Desktop, Claude Code, ChatGPT remote
   MCP, and the generic MCP Inspector connect to the stdio and
   Streamable HTTP transports.

Cross-reference runbooks for details:

- `docs/runbooks/stdio-fixture-server.md` — stdio MCP transport.
- `docs/runbooks/streamable-http-server.md` — Streamable HTTP transport,
  `/health`, `/mcp`, bearer-token auth, request IDs.
- `docs/runbooks/credential-profiles.md` — BYOK profile loader and the
  labels-only contract exposed by the `credential_profiles` MCP tool.
- `docs/runbooks/capture-fixture-import.md` and
  `docs/runbooks/capture-traffic-ir.md` — authorized capture workflow
  (operator-only; never wired into default CI).

## Hard rules (must hold for every operator action)

- **Read-only.** MCP tools must not modify provider accounts, fleets,
  billing settings, saved searches, or user profiles. Do not call any
  endpoint that writes state.
- **Default verification must not call paid or live providers.**
  `npm run lint`, `npm test`, and `npm run build` use the fixture
  provider and sanitized fixtures only.
- **Never commit secrets.** API keys, bearer tokens, cookies, raw HAR
  files, `.env*`, and raw private captures are all gitignored. The
  `.env.example` template documents the env-var form without real
  values.
- **No bypass of authentication, paywalls, CAPTCHA, bot defenses, rate
  limits, or access controls.** Use official APIs, open-data feeds,
  user-provided credentials, or sanitized authorized capture fixtures.
- **MCP responses preserve provenance.** Every vessel-position payload
  must include `source`, `retrievedAt`, `observedAt` when available,
  freshness, coverage caveats, and confidence. Missing AIS coverage,
  stale positions, and no-data provider responses are valid states, not
  errors.

## Provider credentials

The credential profile loader is the only path raw keys take into the
process. See `docs/runbooks/credential-profiles.md` for the full
contract; the operator-facing summary is:

- **Env-var form** (preferred for ephemeral shells and CI secrets):

  ```
  VESSEL_MCP_PROFILE_<LABEL>__<FIELD>=<value>
  ```

  - `<LABEL>` is uppercased in the env var name; the loader normalizes
    it to lowercase with `_` replaced by `-`. Example:
    `VESSEL_MCP_PROFILE_MARINETRAFFIC__API_KEY=...` becomes profile
    label `marinetraffic`.
  - `<FIELD>` is one of `api_key`, `username`, `password`,
    `bearer_token`, `client_id`, `client_secret`, `subscription_key`.
    Unknown fields are silently ignored.
  - Empty values are treated as not set.

- **Local gitignored JSON form** at
  `config/credential-profiles.local.json`:

  ```json
  {
    "profiles": [
      { "label": "marinetraffic-prod", "provider": "marinetraffic", "fields": { "api_key": "..." } },
      { "label": "aisstream-dev",      "provider": "aisstream",     "fields": { "bearer_token": "..." } }
    ]
  }
  ```

  This file is in `.gitignore`. Do not commit it.

- **Merge rule.** When the same label appears in both sources, the
  environment value wins so operators can override a checked-in local
  profile without editing the file.

- **What the MCP surface exposes.** The `credential_profiles` MCP tool
  returns labels, provider hint, source, declared fields, and status
  only — never the secret material. Internal log lines route through
  `redactForLog` and `redactStructured`, which scrub
  `VESSEL_MCP_PROFILE_*` values along with `Authorization: Bearer ...`,
  cookies, `api_key=...`, JWTs (`eyJ...`), AWS access-key IDs, `sk-...`
  tokens, and GitHub `ghp_` tokens.

- **Per-provider env vars (live-test only).** The provider catalog
  (`config/provider-catalog.example.json`) records the env vars each
  provider expects. Examples — none of these are called by default:

  | Provider | Auth profile field(s) | Env var(s) |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | `marinetraffic` | `api_key` | `VESSEL_MCP_PROFILE_MARINETRAFFIC__API_KEY` |
  | `vesselfinder` | `api_key` | `VESSEL_MCP_PROFILE_VESSELFINDER__API_KEY` |
  | `aisstream` | `api_key` | `VESSEL_MCP_PROFILE_AISSTREAM__API_KEY` |
  | `aishub` | `username` | `VESSEL_MCP_PROFILE_AISHUB__USERNAME` |
  | `barentswatch` | `client_id`, `client_secret` | `VESSEL_MCP_PROFILE_BARENTSWATCH__CLIENT_ID`, `VESSEL_MCP_PROFILE_BARENTSWATCH__CLIENT_SECRET` |
  | `searates-schedules` | `api_key` | `VESSEL_MCP_PROFILE_SEARATES_SCHEDULES__API_KEY` |
  | `routescanner-connect` | `api_key` | `VESSEL_MCP_PROFILE_ROUTESCANNER_CONNECT__API_KEY` |
  | `vesselapi` | `api_key` | `VESSEL_MCP_PROFILE_VESSELAPI__API_KEY` |
  | `datadocked` | `api_key` | `VESSEL_MCP_PROFILE_DATADOCKED__API_KEY` |
  | `globalfishingwatch` | `bearer_token` | `VESSEL_MCP_PROFILE_GLOBALFISHINGWATCH__BEARER_TOKEN` |
  | `spire-maritime` | `api_key` | `VESSEL_MCP_PROFILE_SPIRE__API_KEY` |

  Treat this table as a cheat sheet; the catalog file is authoritative.

## Rate limits

Every adapter declares a `RateLimitPolicy` via
`VesselDataProvider.rateLimitPolicy()`
(`src/providers/types.ts`). The shared limiter in
`src/util/rate-limit.ts` turns that policy into a token bucket with
`requestsPerInterval`, `intervalMs`, optional `burst`, and a `scope`
of `per-credential`, `per-instance`, or `global`.

Operator obligations:

- **Honour the declared policy.** Do not raise `requestsPerInterval`,
  shorten `intervalMs`, or remove `scope` to "go faster". Provider terms
  override convenience.
- **Strict community quotas.** AISHub is documented at one request per minute per member username (`config/provider-catalog.example.json` `aishub.cost.quotaNote`); the eventual adapter must keep this throttle exactly. Live-test runs that violate the quota are not allowed.
- **Fixture provider has no effective rate limit.** The fixture
  provider returns `requestsPerInterval: Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` only
  so routing parity holds; nothing real is being called.
- **Quota state surfaces through `provider_status`.** The
  `ProviderStatus.quota.state` enum
  (`not_applicable | unknown | available | limited | exhausted`) is the
  read-only signal MCP clients see. Do not invent quota numbers in
  logs.
- **Backoff is the limiter's job.** When `RateLimiter.consume()`
  returns `allowed: false`, respect `retryAfterMs` — do not retry
  immediately.

## Live-test toggles

Default verification (`npm run lint && npm test && npm run build`) must
not call paid or live providers. Each catalog entry declares its
opt-in flags so operators can enable a single provider explicitly:

- **`liveTest.enabledFlagEnvVar`** — every provider has an opt-in
  flag named `VESSEL_MCP_LIVE_TEST_<PROVIDER>` (validator in
  `src/providers/catalog.ts` enforces the prefix).
- **`liveTest.requiredEnvVars`** — the BYOK env vars that must also be
  set; if any of them are missing the live test must be skipped, not
  failed.
- **`liveTest.defaultDisabled: true`** — every catalog entry must
  declare this. Without it the catalog parser rejects the entry, so
  the project cannot ship a provider that is on by default.

Operator workflow to run a single provider live (only when you have
explicit authorization for that provider and account):

```sh
export VESSEL_MCP_LIVE_TEST_MARINETRAFFIC=1
export VESSEL_MCP_PROFILE_MARINETRAFFIC__API_KEY=<your key>
npm test -- --test-name-pattern='live'   # only if/when live tests are added
```

If either the enable flag or any `requiredEnvVars` value is missing the
live test must skip; default `npm test` runs must continue to pass
without any of these variables set. Never paste keys into shell
history that is checked into version control; prefer a sourced shell
file under `~/.config/` or an OS keychain.

## Client setup

### Local stdio (Claude Desktop, Claude Code)

`vessel-traffic-mcp` is published as the `vessel-traffic-mcp` package
binary. After `npm ci && npm run build`, register the local build with
your MCP client:

- **Claude Desktop / Claude Code**: configure an MCP server entry that
  runs the package binary with `VESSEL_MCP_TRANSPORT=stdio`. The
  binary must not write logs to stdout (stdout is the MCP protocol
  stream); only short, redacted stderr is allowed.
- **Generic MCP Inspector**: run

  ```sh
  npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node dist/index.js
  ```

  and list the `provider_status`, `data_sources`, and
  `credential_profiles` tools.

Reference: `docs/runbooks/stdio-fixture-server.md`.

### Remote Streamable HTTP (ChatGPT remote MCP, hosted Claude)

The Streamable HTTP transport binds to `127.0.0.1:3000` by default and
exposes:

- `GET /health`, `HEAD /health` — public, no bearer required.
- `POST /mcp`, `GET /mcp`, `DELETE /mcp`, `OPTIONS /mcp` — Streamable
  HTTP MCP. Requires `Authorization: Bearer <token>` when
  `VESSEL_MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` is non-empty.

Recommended local environment:

```sh
VESSEL_MCP_TRANSPORT=http
VESSEL_MCP_HTTP_HOST=127.0.0.1
VESSEL_MCP_HTTP_PORT=3000
VESSEL_MCP_AUTH_TOKEN=<rotate per client>
```

Start with `npm run start:http` (or `scripts/run-http-server.sh`). Bind
to `0.0.0.0` only behind a trusted HTTPS reverse proxy that terminates
TLS. Every response carries an `X-Request-Id` header (UUID v4) for
log correlation; request logs go to stderr as JSON and never include
headers, request bodies, bearer tokens, provider query credentials, or
raw provider responses.

Reference: `docs/runbooks/streamable-http-server.md`.

### Read-only contract for every client

Whichever transport you wire up, the tools registered on this server
are read-only and must remain read-only:

- `provider_status` and `data_sources` — fixture-backed diagnostics.
- `credential_profiles` — labels-only profile summary; never raw
  secrets.

When live providers are added later, they must continue to honour the
read-only contract: no fleet edits, no saved-search mutations, no
account changes.

## Verifying this runbook

Run from the project root:

```sh
npm run lint
npm test
npm run build
```

The deterministic test `test/operator-runbook.test.js` asserts:

- this runbook covers all four required surfaces (credentials, rate
  limits, live-test toggles, client setup) and the read-only / no-paid
  defaults;
- the live-test cheat-sheet examples match the catalog
  (`config/provider-catalog.example.json`) for at least one BYOK
  provider — no stale provider IDs or env-var names;
- the runbook does not contain literal credential-shaped strings (JWT,
  AWS access key, `ghp_`, `sk-`);
- the README links to this runbook so operators can discover it.

Default verification does not call any paid or live vessel-data
provider; everything above is checked from local file contents only.
