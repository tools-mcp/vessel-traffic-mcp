# MCP Client Setup Runbook (F1.AC3)

This runbook is the single client-facing entry point for connecting an MCP
client to `vessel-traffic-mcp`. It covers four supported clients:

1. **Claude Desktop** (local stdio)
2. **Claude Code** (local stdio)
3. **ChatGPT remote MCP** (Streamable HTTP at `/mcp`)
4. **Generic MCP Inspector** (`@modelcontextprotocol/inspector`)

Transport-level mechanics live in
[`stdio-fixture-server.md`](./stdio-fixture-server.md) and
[`streamable-http-server.md`](./streamable-http-server.md); BYOK credential
state lives in [`credential-profiles.md`](./credential-profiles.md). This
file documents the client wiring only.

## Hard rules (must hold for every client wiring)

- **Read-only.** MCP tools must not modify provider accounts, fleets,
  billing settings, saved searches, or user profiles. The registered
  tools — `provider_status`, `data_sources`, `credential_profiles`, and
  the F3.AC1 vessel tools — all declare `readOnlyHint: true`.
- **Default verification stays fixture-only.** `npm run lint`,
  `npm test`, and `npm run build` exercise the fixture provider; no
  client configuration in this runbook implies a paid or live call by
  default.
- **Never paste secrets into chat.** `VESSEL_MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` and any
  BYOK provider key must come from the deployment secret store, an OS
  keychain, a sourced shell file, or a gitignored env file — not from a
  pasted client message.
- **stdout is the MCP protocol stream.** When running stdio servers,
  the binary writes only the MCP JSON-RPC frames to stdout. Diagnostic
  output, when emitted at all, must go to stderr with credentials
  redacted.

## Prerequisites

Use Node.js 22 or newer. From a clean checkout:

```bash
npm ci
npm run build
```

After `npm run build` succeeds, the package binary is available at
`dist/index.js` and the symlink `node_modules/.bin/vessel-traffic-mcp`
(when installed as a dependency) or directly at `./dist/index.js`
(when running from the repo). The default transport is stdio; set
`VESSEL_MCP_TRANSPORT=http` to start the Streamable HTTP server
instead.

The current registered tool surface is fixture-backed and read-only:

- `provider_status`, `data_sources`, `credential_profiles`
- `vessel_search`, `vessel_name_resolve`, `document_vessel_lookup`,
  `vessel_position`, `vessel_area`, `vessel_track`, `port_calls`

## Claude Desktop (stdio)

Claude Desktop launches MCP servers from its
`claude_desktop_config.json` file. Add a `vessel-traffic-mcp` entry
that runs the built binary with `VESSEL_MCP_TRANSPORT=stdio`. Use an
absolute path; Claude Desktop does not run inside the repository
checkout.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "vessel-traffic-mcp": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/vessel-traffic-mcp/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "VESSEL_MCP_TRANSPORT": "stdio"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop after editing the config. In a new chat, the
`vessel-traffic-mcp` server should appear in the tool listing with the
read-only tools enumerated above.

BYOK profile env vars (only when you have explicit authorization for
that provider and account) go in the same `env` block:

```json
"env": {
  "VESSEL_MCP_TRANSPORT": "stdio",
  "VESSEL_MCP_PROFILE_MARINETRAFFIC__API_KEY": "<your key>"
}
```

Do not paste real keys into chat. Keep them in this local config file
only; the config file lives outside this repository.

Reference: [`stdio-fixture-server.md`](./stdio-fixture-server.md).

## Claude Code (stdio)

Claude Code reads the same `claude_desktop_config.json`-style schema
through its CLI. To register the server for a single project, add a
`.mcp.json` file at the project root (or use `claude mcp add`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "vessel-traffic-mcp": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/vessel-traffic-mcp/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "VESSEL_MCP_TRANSPORT": "stdio"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Alternatively, run the binary inline for an ad-hoc session:

```bash
VESSEL_MCP_TRANSPORT=stdio /absolute/path/to/vessel-traffic-mcp/dist/index.js
```

Claude Code will surface the read-only tools and route tool calls
through stdio. The same secret rules as Claude Desktop apply: BYOK
keys go in the project-local `.mcp.json` env block (gitignored) or in
the operator shell — never pasted into chat.

## ChatGPT remote MCP (Streamable HTTP)

ChatGPT remote MCP connects over Streamable HTTP. The server must be
reachable over HTTPS from ChatGPT, so this client always runs against
the HTTP transport behind a trusted TLS reverse proxy. Local-only
testing is supported by tunnelling to `127.0.0.1`.

Server side, start the HTTP transport:

```bash
export VESSEL_MCP_TRANSPORT=http
export VESSEL_MCP_HTTP_HOST=127.0.0.1
export VESSEL_MCP_HTTP_PORT=3000
export VESSEL_MCP_AUTH_TOKEN="<a-strong-random-token-you-generated>"
npm run start:http
```

Endpoints:

- `GET /health` and `HEAD /health` — public, no bearer token required.
- `POST /mcp`, `GET /mcp`, `DELETE /mcp`, `OPTIONS /mcp` — Streamable
  HTTP MCP. Requires `Authorization: Bearer <token>` when
  `VESSEL_MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` is non-empty.

Every response includes an `X-Request-Id` header (UUID v4) for log
correlation. Request logs go to stderr as JSON and never include
request headers, request bodies, bearer tokens, provider query
credentials, or raw provider responses.

In the ChatGPT remote MCP connector UI, configure:

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Endpoint URL | `https://<your-public-host>/mcp` |
| Authentication | Bearer token: `<the same value as VESSEL_MCP_AUTH_TOKEN>` |
| Transport | Streamable HTTP |

Health probe (no auth):

```bash
curl -sf "https://<your-public-host>/health"
```

MCP probe (bearer auth):

```bash
curl -sS -X POST "https://<your-public-host>/mcp" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $VESSEL_MCP_AUTH_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: application/json, text/event-stream" \
  --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/list"}'
```

Bind to `0.0.0.0` only behind a trusted HTTPS reverse proxy that
terminates TLS. For the full deployment contract — multi-stage
`Dockerfile`, `.dockerignore` secret boundary, nginx/Caddy/managed-
platform HTTPS topologies, and token rotation — see
[`deployment-https.md`](./deployment-https.md).

Reference: [`streamable-http-server.md`](./streamable-http-server.md).

## Generic MCP Inspector

The generic [`@modelcontextprotocol/inspector`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@modelcontextprotocol/inspector)
is the supported tool for ad-hoc exploration and tool-schema
inspection. It can drive either transport.

### Inspector against stdio

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node dist/index.js
```

You should see the read-only tools list and be able to call
`provider_status`, `data_sources`, and `credential_profiles` against
the fixture provider.

### Inspector against Streamable HTTP

Start the HTTP server as in the ChatGPT section above, then point the
Inspector at the `/mcp` endpoint with the bearer token:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector \
  --transport streamable-http \
  --server-url "http://127.0.0.1:3000/mcp" \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer $VESSEL_MCP_AUTH_TOKEN"
```

Use `127.0.0.1` for local-only inspection; do not expose the bearer
token over a non-TLS hop.

## Read-only contract for every client

Whichever client you wire up, the registered tools must remain
read-only. When live providers are added later they continue to
honour the same contract: no fleet edits, no saved-search mutations,
no account changes. Missing AIS coverage, stale positions, and
no-data provider responses are valid result states, not infrastructure
errors.

## Verifying this runbook

Run from the project root:

```bash
npm run lint
npm test
npm run build
```

The deterministic test `test/client-setup.test.js` asserts that this
runbook covers all four required clients, names the read-only tools,
points at both transports with the right env-var contract, and does
not contain credential-shaped strings. Default verification does not
call any paid or live vessel-data provider; everything above is
checked from local file contents only.
